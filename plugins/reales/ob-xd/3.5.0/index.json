  "description": "Based on the Oberheim OB-X. It attempts to recreate its sound and behaviours, but as the original was very limited in some important ways a number of things were added or altered to the original design. The OB-Xd was designed to sound as good and as rich as the original. It implements micro random detuning which is a big part of that sound.",
